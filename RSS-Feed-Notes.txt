Encountered error: Installed Build Tools revision 31.0.0 is corrupted
Solution: either downlevel to version 30 or go to following file location:
C:\Users\Alex\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\build-tools\31.0.0
change d8.bat to dx.bat
and go to C:\Users\Alex\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\build-tools\31.0.0\lib
change d8.jar to dx.jar

Added toString() methods to Feed.java, Entry.java, Author.java because it returns memory location otherwise

Changed String author to Author author because it was returning null

For each entry:
grabbing Entry object: author, title, updated parameters from list of entries.
   easy, just call entry.getters.
content tag
   hard would be getting <content> info. &lt == <  &gt == >
   Trying to gra the Cdata from content tag
   copy content tag from xml code
   paste in HTML viewer
   copy and paste only info within content tags
   Run the html viewer on that info
   copy the output and paste in another html viewer
   beautify it
